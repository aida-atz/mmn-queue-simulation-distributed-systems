# MMN Queue Simulation - Distributed Computing

This project implements a discrete event simulation (DES) framework for:

- M/M/N queue model
- Supermarket load balancing (power of d choices)
- Weibull service distribution
- Priority scheduling
- Least Work Left (LWL) strategy
- Hybrid LWL + Supermarket model

The project analyzes system behavior under different arrival rates (λ), service rates (μ), and load balancing strategies.

Developed for the Distributed Computing course.
